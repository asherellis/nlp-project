The battle for Sloviansk is likely to be the next key contest in the struggle for Donbas as Russian forces approach within 10 miles (16km) of the Donetsk town, the UK Ministry of Defence said on Wednesday. Russian forces from the eastern and western groups of forces are likely now about 16km north of Sloviansk as central and southern groups of forces also pose a threat to the town, according to the latest British intelligence report.
