Vladimir Putin described western sanctions against Russia as “reckless and insane” and of trying to “crush the Russian economy in one go by force”. The European Union has “completely lost sovereignty” he said, and is “dancing to someone else’s tunes”. He accused the EU of “taking everything that is dictated to them and dealing harm” to its population, business and economy. The Russian president was addressing the St Petersburg Economic Forum almost two hours behind schedule after a “denial of service” cyber-attack.
