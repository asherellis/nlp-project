    "answer": "The main political tensions surrounding India's proposed civil nuclear partnership with the United States stemmed from concerns that India was kowtowing to the U.S. and surrendering its sovereignty. The opposition to the deal was led by the leaders of India's two communist parties, who accused Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of compromising India's interests. The deal also sparked a no-confidence vote in Parliament, which Singh narrowly survived with a vote of 275-256.",

    "question": "How did Russia\u2019s inability to make scheduled payments on its foreign bonds escalate into what analysts considered a default, and what specific factors\u2014including sanctions\u2014made the situation effectively unavoidable?",
    "answer": "Russia's inability to make scheduled payments on its foreign bonds escalated into what analysts considered a default when the US Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) effectively blocked Moscow from making payments, which was considered an insurmountable roadblock in late May. This situation was further exacerbated by sanctions imposed over Russia's war in Ukraine, which prevented intermediaries from transferring payments, making the default effectively unavoidable.",

    "question": "What broader economic and geopolitical consequences did analysts expect from Russia\u2019s 2022 foreign-debt default, and why was the impact considered less severe than the country\u2019s default in the late 1990s?",
    "answer": "Investment analysts are cautiously reckoning that a Russian default would not have the kind of impact on global financial markets and institutions that came from its default in 1998. This is likely because Russia cannot borrow internationally at the moment and does not need to, thanks to plentiful oil and gas export revenues.",

General Lord Richards, on the other hand, argued that Western leaders lacked a long-term strategy in the conflict, adopting a \"let's see how it goes\" approach and failing to show decisiveness. This suggests that Richards believes the main weakness lies within the Western leadership's decision-making and planning.",

    "answer": "Korea became the object of intense imperialistic rivalry among the Chinese, Japanese, and Russian empires in the latter half of the 19th and early 20th centuries. This period was shaped by two key wars: the Sino-Japanese War (1894-95) and the Russo-Japanese War (1904-05). These wars ultimately led to Korea being occupied by Imperial Japan in 1910.",
