Spain and Greece objected to the plan, arguing that they relied far less on Russian supplies than Germany and therefore should not face identical cuts. Their resistance illustrated internal EU tensions caused by uneven exposure to Russia\u2019s energy leverage.", "evidence_sentences": ["S6"], "edge_case_type": "precise_fact_retrieval", "rubric": {"description": "Custom rubric assessing retrieval of specific factual details and correct grounding in the article.", "scale": {"1": "Incorrect or fabricated; does not identify the EU disagreement or misstates countries involved.", "2": "Mentions disagreement vaguely but does not correctly identify Spain and Greece or misstates the reason for objections.", "3": "Correctly states that disagreements existed and identifies at least one of the two countries (Spain/Greece), but explanation is incomplete or slightly inaccurate.", "4": "Accurately states that Spain and Greece objected due to lower reliance on Russian gas, with mostly correct context and no added hallucinations.", "5": "Fully faithful to the article: names both Spain and Greece, explains that the dispute centered on EU-wide mandatory gas-use cuts, and notes their argument that they are less reliant on Russia than Germany.

He prioritized relations with the UK and US but avoided entanglements with regional disputes. This approach helped Oman maintain stability and constructive diplomacy. In 2011, demonstrations inspired by broader regional uprisings demanded more jobs, economic benefits, and an end to corruption. In response, Qaboos expanded the powers of Oman\u2019s legislature, authorized direct elections for its lower house, and introduced economic measures like unemployment benefit increases.", "evidence_sentences": ["S5", "S6", "S7", "S8", "S9"], "edge_case_type": "none", "rubric": {"description": "5-point rubric requiring explicit factual elements grounded in the article.", "scale": {"1": "Missing or incorrect.

Must include ALL: (1) modernization opening Oman, (2) strategic ties to UK/US, (3) maintaining moderate independent foreign policy, (4) 2011 protests calling for jobs/economic benefits/end corruption, and (5) reforms: expanded legislative power + direct elections + job creation / unemployment benefits.

It only states that journalists observed a heavy security presence and that opposition officials described the deployment as \u201cmassive.\u201d It also mentions individual irregularities, such as accreditation problems at 19 stations and voters registered at nonexistent addresses, but not any overall proportion.
