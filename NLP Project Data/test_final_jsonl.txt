Member states agreed to reduce gas consumption by 15% over the winter. The decision included exemptions for certain countries and was adopted despite Hungary\u2019s opposition. The measure was intended to help Germany and the wider EU reduce dependence on Russian energy supplies.

Rising ethnic tensions and returning fighters from Libya contributed to the 2012 rebellion, during which rebels expelled the Malian military from three northern regions and allowed terrorist groups to establish strongholds. Although a 2013 French-led intervention retook much of the territory, the government continued to face persistent insecurity from militias, insurgents, and terrorists. Limited progress on implementing the 2015 peace accord left armed actors entrenched. Political instability deepened after the 2020 and 2021 military coups led by Assimi Go\u00efta, the creation of a transition government, and repeated delays to elections. By 2024, Mali had withdrawn from ECOWAS and remained unable to fully control the north due to overlapping conflicts, weakened institutions, and fragmented armed groups.", "evidence_sentences": ["S12", "S15", "S16", "S17", "S18", "S19", "S20", "S21", "S25", "S26", "S27", "S28", "S31"], "edge_case_type": "none", "rubric": {"description": "Rubric assessing whether the answer fully explains instability, rebellions, and coups.", "scale": {"1": "Ignores major events such as the 1991 transition, 2012 rebellion, or 2020\u201321 coups.", "2": "Mentions only one or two events with little explanation.", "3": "Includes some correct events but lacks causal links or chronology.", "4": "Mostly complete; may omit one detail, such as 2024 ECOWAS withdrawal.", "5": "Fully complete: covers 1991 coup, 2012 rebellion, terrorist strongholds, 2015 accord failures, 2020\u201321 coups, election delays, and ECOWAS withdrawal, linking each to loss of territorial control."}}}

To ensure the vote could occur, five members of parliament who were in prison were temporarily released specifically so they could cast their ballots. Their jailers accompanied them during the vote.
