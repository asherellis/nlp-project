His son, KIM Jong Il, continued this trend, and KIM Jong Un, who has occupied the regime's highest political and military posts since 2011, has also prioritized maintaining autocratic one-party rule under the Korean Worker\u2019s Party. This dynastic leadership structure has likely contributed to North Korea's isolated and impoverished state, as well as its pursuit of \"self-reliant\" policies and nuclear weapons development.",

German officials, including Robert Habeck, the minister for economic affairs, were concerned that there would be a complete stop to Russian gas deliveries after the scheduled shutdown of Nord Stream 1 for an annual inspection in July, which would exacerbate a high risk of long-term supply shortages, as stated by the German economic ministry.",
