    "answer": "The proposed civil nuclear partnership with the United States sparked opposition and concerns from the Indian opposition that India was kowtowing to the U.S. and that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was surrendering India's sovereignty to the United States with the deal. This opposition led to a no-confidence vote against Singh, which he narrowly survived. The Indian leaders of the two communist parties, which hold about 60 seats in Parliament, were among those who accused Singh of surrendering India's sovereignty with the deal.",

    "answer": "Russia's reduction of gas flows through Nord Stream 1 prompted a four- to sixfold rise in market prices, potentially leading to a tripling of gas prices for German consumers, and a doubling or tripling of costs is possible. German officials, including the head of the federal network agency and the minister for economic affairs, are concerned that Russia may not switch the gas tap back on after the scheduled July shutdown of Nord Stream 1 for an annual inspection. This concern has led officials to warn of a high risk of long-term supply shortages, prompting the German economic ministry to announce the second of three energy emergency plan phases.",

European colonial rule, particularly the Belgians, reinforced existing trends toward autocratic and exclusionary rule, leading to the elimination of traditional Hutu positions of authority and increased resentment among the Hutu population. This simmering resentment eventually boiled over into the 1959 overthrow of the Tutsi king, and the post-independence power struggles, including the rule of President Habyarimana, further exacerbated ethnic tensions, ultimately contributing to the 1994 genocide in Rwanda.",

They also pointed to issues such as voter confusion, limited voter education, and the absence of international media and independent observers, which heightened their concerns about the election's fairness. These concerns were especially significant given the political context surrounding Robert Mugabe's long rule, as his 28-year rule had led to economic deterioration, human rights abuses, and a lack of trust in the electoral commission, which critics saw as partisan toward the ruling Zanu-PF party.",

    "question": "According to the historical account provided, which foreign powers competed for influence over Korea in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and what key wars shaped this period?",
    "answer": "Korea became the object of intense imperialistic rivalry among the Chinese (its traditional benefactor), Japanese, and Russian empires in the latter half of the 19th and early 20th centuries. The key wars that shaped this period were the Sino-Japanese War (1894-95) and the Russo-Japanese War (1904-05), which led to Korea's occupation by Imperial Japan in 1910.",
