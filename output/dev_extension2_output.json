    "question": "What disagreements emerged within the European Union regarding proposed gas-use reductions, and which countries argued that they should not have to cut consumption equally?",
    "answer": "Southern European countries, particularly Spain, Portugal, and Greece, led opposition to the uniform 15% gas-use reduction target, arguing it was unfair and failed to account for their national circumstances. Spain, in particular, argued that the initial proposal was \"not necessarily the most effective approach\" and claimed to have \"done our homework\" by investing in infrastructure to boost supplies of liquified natural gas.",

    "question": "How did Oman's leadership under Sultan Qaboos manage to balance modernization with foreign policy independence, and what domestic pressures in 2011 led him to expand political participation?",
    "answer": "Sultan Qaboos managed to balance modernization with foreign policy independence by prioritizing strategic ties to the UK and US while maintaining good relations with its neighbors and avoiding external entanglements through a moderate, independent foreign policy. In 2011, domestic pressures led by popular uprisings inspired demonstrations in Oman that called for more jobs, economic benefits, and an end to corruption, prompting Sultan Qaboos to implement economic and political reforms including granting Oman's legislative body more power and authorizing direct elections for its lower house.",

    "answer": "The document does not provide sufficient information to answer the question about the total number of soldiers and police deployed across Zimbabwe during the election. However, it is mentioned that there was a \"massive\" deployment of soldiers and police at most stations, according to Movement for Democratic Change Secretary-General Tenda Biti, but journalists disagreed with this description.",
