    "answer": "The proposed civil nuclear partnership sparked opposition and concerns from the Indian opposition that India was kowtowing to the U.S. and surrendering its sovereignty. The opposition, led by the communist parties, held about 60 seats in Parliament and accused Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of making concessions to the United States. This led to a no-confidence vote against Singh, which he narrowly survived with a vote of 275-256.",

Sanctions imposed over its war in Ukraine were a significant factor in the situation becoming effectively unavoidable, as investors had long expected a default and rating agencies had placed Russia's debt in junk territory. The sanctions had already cut Russia off from western capital markets and disrupted the country's trade and financial ties with the rest of the world, making it difficult for Russia to borrow internationally.",

    "answer": "Russia's reduction of gas flows through Nord Stream 1 is expected to cause a tripling of gas prices for German consumers in the coming months, and has prompted Germany to activate its second energy emergency plan phase, enabling utility firms to pass on high gas prices to customers to lower demand. German officials are concerned about the period following the pipeline's scheduled July shutdown, as they worry that Russia might not switch the gas tap back on after the inspection, which would exacerbate Germany's already dire gas supply situation. The German government has also expressed concern that there is a high risk of long-term supply shortages due to Russia systematically choking off gas deliveries.",

European colonial powers, particularly the Belgians, shifted their support from Tutsi to Hutu leaders in the years leading up to independence, which contributed to the simmering resentment of minority rule. This, combined with post-independence power struggles and the eventual extremist Hutu factions gaining prominence, exacerbated ethnic tensions and ultimately culminated in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda.",

    "answer": "Russia's President Vladimir V. Putin was using his country's energy exports as a tool to punish and divide European leaders, loosening or tightening natural gas flows as it suited him and his war aims in Ukraine. This uncertainty imposed heavy economic and political costs on European leaders, who were under growing pressure to bring down energy prices and avoid gas rationing that might force factories and government buildings to close.",

    "question": "According to the historical account provided, which foreign powers competed for influence over Korea in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and what key wars shaped this period?",
    "answer": "According to the historical account provided, Japan became a regional power in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, defeating the forces of both China and Russia, and occupied Korea, among other territories. This period was shaped by Japan's wars with China, particularly the full-scale invasion of China in 1937, and its eventual conflict with the US, which was triggered by Japan's attack on US forces at Pearl Harbor in 1941.",
