    "question": "What specific EU energy measure was scheduled to take effect according to the report, and what key details did member states agree on regarding the scope and level of gas reductions?",
    "answer": "The EU energy measure scheduled to take effect was a voluntary 15% reduction in gas usage over the winter, which could become mandatory if the Kremlin ordered a complete shutdown of gas to Europe. Member states agreed to exempt island nations and countries little connected to the European gas network, and countries with electricity systems linked to Russia, such as the Baltic states, could also apply for an exemption.",

    "question": "How did long-term political instability, recurring coups, and the emergence of northern armed groups shape Mali\u2019s struggle to maintain territorial control from 1991 through 2024?",
    "answer": "Mali's struggle to maintain territorial control was shaped by long-term political instability, including a 31-year dictatorship that ended in 1991, followed by recurring coups and the emergence of northern armed groups. In 2012, a rebellion and military coup led to the expulsion of the military from the country's three northern regions, allowing terrorist organizations to develop strongholds. The government regained control with a 2013 French-led military intervention but its grasp in the region remains weak, with local militias, terrorists, and insurgent groups competing for control.",
