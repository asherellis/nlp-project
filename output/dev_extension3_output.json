    "question": "What disagreements emerged within the European Union regarding proposed gas-use reductions, and which countries argued that they should not have to cut consumption equally?",
    "answer": "Southern European countries, led by Spain, Portugal, and Greece, argued that the proposed 15% reduction in gas usage was unfair and did not take into account their national circumstances. Spain, in particular, rejected the proposal, stating that the initial proposal was \"not necessarily the most effective approach\" and that they had invested in infrastructure to boost supplies of liquified natural gas, which was seen as an implicit criticism of Germany's reliance on Russian gas.",

    "question": "How did Oman's leadership under Sultan Qaboos manage to balance modernization with foreign policy independence, and what domestic pressures in 2011 led him to expand political participation?",
    "answer": "Oman's leadership under Sultan Qaboos balanced modernization with foreign policy independence by prioritizing strategic ties to the UK and US, and maintaining a moderate, independent foreign policy that allowed the country to maintain good relations with its neighbors and avoid external entanglements. In response to domestic pressures in 2011, which included popular uprisings calling for more jobs and economic benefits and an end to corruption, Sultan Qaboos implemented economic and political reforms, including granting Oman's legislative body more power, authorizing direct elections for its lower house, increasing unemployment benefits, and mandating a national job creation plan.",
