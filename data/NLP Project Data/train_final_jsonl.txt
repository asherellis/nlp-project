German and Belgian colonial rule hardened ethnic divisions by reinforcing Tutsi authority, imposing heavy labor and taxes on Hutus, and later shifting political favor toward Hutu elites. These policies deepened resentment and fueled the 1959 uprising that overthrew the Tutsi king, driving many Tutsis into exile. Exiled Tutsis later formed the Rwandan Patriotic Front, whose 1990 rebellion further intensified ethnic polarization. When President Habyarimana\u2019s plane was shot down in 1994, extremist networks used the moment to launch the genocide. The combination of entrenched hierarchies, colonial manipulation, and decades of post-independence exclusion set the stage for the mass violence.", "evidence_sentences": ["S1", "S2", "S3", "S6", "S7", "S8", "S9", "S10", "S11", "S12", "S13", "S14", "S15", "S16", "S17", "S18"], "edge_case_type": "none", "rubric": {"description": "Custom 5-point rubric evaluating factual accuracy, completeness, and grounding in the Rwanda article.", "scale": {"1": "Answer is largely incorrect or invented; does not reflect the article; confuses key actors or events.", "2": "Mentions some relevant points but omits major historical phases (e.g., colonial rule or post-independence conflicts) or includes unsupported claims.", "3": "Captures the broad sequence of events but misses several key details such as colonial favoritism shifts, the 1959 uprising, or the role of exiled Tutsis; partially grounded.", "4": "Mostly complete and accurate, covering at least two of the three eras (pre-colonial, colonial, post-independence) with only minor missing details.", "5": "Fully correct and well-grounded: explains pre-colonial hierarchies, colonial reinforcement and shifts, the 1959 uprising, exile communities, the Rwandan Patriotic Front rebellion, and the trigger event of 1994 without adding unsupported facts."}}}

They also pointed to a large security force presence and irregularities like voters registered at nonexistent addresses and names of long-dead colonial figures on voter rolls. Human Rights Watch warned that the electoral commission was partisan toward Zanu-PF and lacked the competence to manage the process fairly.
